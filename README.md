# Hermione: A3 Internal Module Plugins

This is a repository for all Eu.A3 to share their Data Science work.

To start, just add your module to the "module_templates" folder and make a pull request.

Remember to add a "_alpha" or "_beta" suffix to the folder name, so other users can know how mature your template is.

All the templates added to this project will be available in `hermione add-module` cli command ( for everyone that have installed this module).
